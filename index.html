        <h2>To the Love of My Life</h2>

        <p>
          They say all love begins when eyes meet,<br />
          but do they say of the souls morphing into one?<br />
          because that is exactly what happened when I saw you for the first
          time.
          <br />
          It was no chance, it was no coincidence.<br />
          It was fate that brought us.
          <br />
          I looked at you and I saw my soul reflected.<br />
          That is something I never thought I'd ever say,<br />
          but you proved to me that there is a lot in me than I ever thought.
          <br />And that there's more to life than I ever believed. <br />I wish
          you'd take a look inside of me and see for yourself the endless garden
          you have bloomed in my heart. <br />When you first met me, I did not
          believe in God,<br />
          nor did I believe in myself. <br />I was a wreck, I was nothing,<br />
          but you took me into your arms <br />and you've shown me what true
          beauty really is.<br />
          It was through you that I discovered not only myself,<br />
          but discovered what life is meant to be and how life is meant to be
          lived.<br />
          You've made me someone that who once rejected life,<br />
          to someone that would fight to his last drop of blood for your
          happiness.<br />
          I no longer wanted to search for meaning. I no longer wanted to search
          for God,<br />
          I took one look at you and I knew for sure that God does exist.<br />
          I took one look at you and I saw the most divine face that ever
          blessed this earth. <br />And yes, you are a blessing indeed. You have
          blessed me not only for showing me warmth and happiness, but for
          ridding me of my sins. <br />You're like an angel, but sweeter.<br />
          A goddess, but hollier. <br />You are a savior not only to my poor
          soul but to all the icons and <br />symbols of love and beauty in this
          world.<br />
          You are what it means to love more than words could describe.<br />
          You are what it means to breathe more than my lungs could prove.<br />
          You are what it means to live, far beyond every soul and every birth
          in this world.<br />
          You are myself more than I get to be, and I am you more than you allow
          yourself to be.<br />
          As long as I have the means to breathe and to wake,<br />
          all I ever want to do is to love you and cherish you and worship
          you,<br />
          you have no idea how much I love you<br />
          and you won't ever believe how hard I grow more in love with you every
          passing day. <br />You do not complete, you create.<br />
          So I will not say that you complete me,<br />
          for you have completely shaped me, made me who I am,<br />
          breathed tenderness into me, cradled and embraced me<br />
          and for that I only ever want to exist through you.<br />
          To make you the happiest, I want to be your heart,<br />
          to make you the safest, I want to be your shield. <br />I could never
          feel okay with my own self, <br />I always need to be better for
          you,<br />
          I always need to be someone you could cherish.<br />
          Someone worthy of your love and trust,<br />
          for you have given me more love and more passion than I ever
          dreamed.<br />
          You have shown me Heaven and bathed me in the gardens of Eden
          <br />when I wasn't so sure that such holliness ever exist.<br />
          You are the my moon in the night, and my sun in the dawn. <br />I do
          not want to ever be anywhere but under your comforting shadow,<br />
          for I would much rather take up a moment of you <br />than a lifetime
          of myself. <br />For I would choose to be your lover for a blink<br />
          than to be alone with myself for eternity. <br />If you are mine by
          choice then I will forever choose you,<br />
          and if you are mine by force then I shall forever succumb and submit
          to you.<br />
          I will not resist your temptation <br />nor would I resist my own
          burning desire <br />and my everlasting urge to be with you for every
          second of my existence.

          i carry your heart with me (i carry it in<br />
          my heart) i am never without it (anywhere<br />
          i go you go, my dear; and whatever is done<br />
          by only me is your doing, my darling)<br />
          i fear<br />
          no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) i want<br />
          no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)<br />
          and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant<br />
          and whatever a sun will always sing is you<br />

          here is the deepest secret nobody knows<br />
          (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud<br />
          and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows<br />
          higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)<br />
          and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart<br />

          i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)

        <p>
          You told me that Pictures of You reminds you of me <br />
          And I've told you that the whole album is a beautiful ensemble<br />
          With every lyric reminding me of you.<br />
          But I haven't told you about one song that always resonated with me
          <br />
          Whenever I listened to "The Same Deep Water as You"<br />
          all I could ever feel was you. All I could ever feel was us. <br />The
          circumstances we've met in. The events that went through us.<br />
          The things we had to do, the days we had to live through.<br />
          The nights we had to push through. Every hardship and every misery,
          <br />I always knew that I will always be with you no matter what.<br />
          I always knew that no matter what will come,<br />
          I will always be there to guide you out of it,<br />
          to love you, to hug you, to kiss you, <br />to show you that you make
          me move mountains.<br />
          I don't care what else goes on,<br />
          as long as you are here and myself.<br />
          There is no soul and there is no force on this earth that will
          seperate us.<br />
          They have tried, and they can keep trying.<br />
          I know you're scared because you think that I might leave.<br />
          Because you think they can destroy me and destroy our love, <br />just
          like how they destroyed everything.<br />
          Just like how they destroyed you and abused you,<br />
          but that is not what's going to happen this time. <br />They don't get
          to take me away from you,<br />
          they do not have the power to make me leave.<br />
          I will never leave you. I've always seen you,<br />
          even long before we talked..<br />
          I've always seen your pain and felt it. <br />I've always seen your
          struggles and felt it.<br />
          I have always felt your sadness <br />and I took a vow to always stand
          by your side, <br />to always be with you, to always be your lover,<br />
          to always be your guardian.<br />
          To always love you and worship you and comfort you<br />
          I am unshaken, My love is only growing stronger.<br />
          I will alwys be yours <br />
          And you will always be mine<br />
          I am only about to show you<br />
          How much I love you<br />
          And how truly.. <br />
          I cannot live without you<br />
          We are in the same deep water.<br />
          Together.<br />
          Our story is only just about to begin :)<br />
          You are my destiny.

          "Kiss me goodbye," pushing out before I sleep <br />
          It's lower now, and slower now<br />
          The strangest twist upon your lips<br />
          But I don't see, and I don't feel<br />
          But tightly hold up silently<br />
          My hands, before my fading eyes<br />
          And in my eyes your smile<br />
          The very last thing before I go<br />
          The very last thing before I go<br />
          The very last thing before I go<br />
          I will kiss you, I will kiss you<br />
          I will kiss you forever on nights like this<br />
          I will kiss you, I will kiss you<br />
          And we shall be together
